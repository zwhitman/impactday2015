Posse partner colleges and universities award Posse Scholars four-year, full-tuition leadership scholarships. In order to develop crucial soft skills necessary for academic and career success, Posse scholars will navigate through a simulated day-in-the-life at Deloitte.  This interactive day will consist of Posse scholars interfacing (in small groups) with Deloitte staff to develop skills that they will utilize as scholars in high school, college, and in the work place.\n\nThe goal of the activities will be to develop their leadership and team building skills; ability to communicate; manage time effectively; and improve presentation skills.\t\n\n1. Posse scholars will be randomly divided into teams of 5-6.    1-2 Deloitte practitioners will work with each group to provide guidance and help facilitate the break-out sessions.  \n \n2. Each group will receive a business case that will require the group to meet deadlines, collect requirements, attend or conduct interviews and client meetings, and outline presentations.\n\n3. Students will be required to divide work evenly, multi-task, interact with positive and difficult clients, navigate an internal structure (partner approval), and develop and deliver a presentation put together with the assistance of Deloitte staff.\n\n4. Deloitte and Posse leaders will critique and provide feedback at various milestones throughout the day so that they may capitalize on their strengths and recognize development areas that they can take with them going forward. \n\n5. We will provide roadblocks, physical relocation, difficult client meetings and other unexpected interruptions to help prepare scholars for various situations as they arise and how to compose\/handle themselves.\n\n6.
